I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University. I am advised by Professor [Alexander Vladimirsky](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~vlad/) in the Department of Mathematics.

My current research interests are in numerical optimal control especially continous path planning problems.

Beforing joining Cornell, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics & Applied Mathematics ([Zhiyuan College](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en)) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in July 2017.
