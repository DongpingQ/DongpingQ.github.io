I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University. I am advised by Professor [Alexander Vladimirsky](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~vlad/) in the Department of Mathematics.
My Ph.D. committee also include Professor [David Bindel](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/) and Professor [Anil Damle](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~damle/).  

My current research lies mainly in numerical optimal control especially continuous path planning problems.
Some of the recent projects are listed [here](/research.html).

Before joining Cornell, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics & Applied Mathematics ([Zhiyuan College](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en)) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in July 2017, where I was supervised by Professor [Lei Zhang](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/lzhang/home.html).
