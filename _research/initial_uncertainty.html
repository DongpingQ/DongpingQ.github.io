title: "Path-planning with uncertainty: a simple model"
excerpt: "What should a planner do if a list of possible targets are known initially (instead of a single deterministic one), and the true one is revealed only after a certain time? What if the information can be obtained gradually? Can the planner make robust decisions? <br/><img src='/images/initial_uncertainty.png'>"

		<p>
			There are already plenty of work on planning under uncertainty.
			Here we consider a simple model, where the uncertainty can be removed at a later time \( T\) with different variations:
		</p>

		<ul>
		  <li> A fixed deterministic \(T\)</li>
			<li> A random \(T\) with a discrete distribution</li>
			<li> A random \(T\) with a discrete, stage-different distribution</li>
			<li> A random \(T\) with an exponential distribution</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The stage-differently distributed \(T\) can be illustrated by <a href="drones.html">this motion picture</a>.
			Assuming there are 4 possible target locations but only one of them is the true one.
			Starting from the source, we send out 3 drones to check each location while move to a better waypoint in the meantime.

			Joint work with Adam Dhillon and Alexander Vladimirsky.
