      One famous interpretation of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780459">ResNet</a>(Residual network) is to
      view the layer-to-layer transformation

      as the discretization of a dynamical system(see <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/69386f6bb1dfed68692a24c8686939b9-Paper.pdf">Neural ODE</a>).
      As a result, the process of training can be viewed as a numerical optimal control problem where weights and biases are control variables.
      This also shows the possibility of using numerical schemes as instructions for developing/improving the structures of deep neural networks.

      The following is

      On the other hand, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125">physics informed neural networks</a>(PINN)
      offers an approach to solve high dimensional PDEs without a computational grid.
      Some control problems need to solve a high dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which may take advantage of this.

      For example, the following figure is a slice of a 4D distance function trained with data generated from Eikonal solutions with black dots as sources.
      This slice shows the shortest distance from each point in a domain(with an obstacle) towards the source (0.3,0.1).
